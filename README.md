# Assessment Mindset
by David Sopas [@dsopas](https://twitter.com/dsopas)

## Why
I did this to help me on my all-around assessments (pentest, bug bounty, red-team) and to keep my work organized.
Each time I finish a task, I marked it with a check icon using [XMind](https://www.xmind.net/). If you don't have this tool, print the image version and use your pencil to mark it as done.

Included in this mindset is [WAHH Methodology](http://mdsec.net/wahh/tasks.html) and [API Security Checklist](https://github.com/shieldfy/API-Security-Checklist).

On particular lines you have notes (only in XMind format) that describe some tools you might use for that particular task.

## Formats
If you don't have XMind software, I exported the JPG and PNG version. If you need other format, please let me know and if many people ask it I can start exporting it in future versions.

## Contribute
New tasks, tools, typos and other things you think it would help this mindset, add a new issue on Github for discussion and validation. This is open to all the infosec community so let us all keep things rolling.
