# Security Assessment Mindset

![Cool image from Char49](https://char49.com/labs/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/mindset.jpg)

## Why
I did this to help me on my security assessments (pentest, bug bounty, red-team, kung) and to keep my work well organized.

Each time I finished a task, I marked it with a check icon using [XMind](https://www.xmind.net/). If you don't have this tool, print the image version and use your pencil to mark it as done.

Included in this mindset is [WAHH Methodology](http://mdsec.net/wahh/tasks.html) and [API Security Checklist](https://github.com/shieldfy/API-Security-Checklist).

On some particular tasks you have notes (only in XMind format) that provide the name of some tools or links you might use for that particular task.

## Formats
If you don't have XMind software, I exported the PNG and the Freemind version. If you need other format, please let me know so I can start exporting it in future versions.

## How to contribute

Remember that tis is open to ALL infosec community so let us all keep things rolling  :thumbsup:. Any question, feel free to ping me at [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/dsopas).
