# Security Assessment Mindset
by David Sopas [@dsopas](https://twitter.com/dsopas)

## Why
I did this to help me on my all-around security assessments (pentest, bug bounty, red-team) and to keep my work organized.

Each time I finished a task, I marked it with a check icon using [XMind](https://www.xmind.net/). If you don't have this tool, print the image version and use your pencil to mark it as done.

Included in this mindset is [WAHH Methodology](http://mdsec.net/wahh/tasks.html) and [API Security Checklist](https://github.com/shieldfy/API-Security-Checklist).

On some particular tasks you have notes (only in XMind format) that provide name of some tools you might use for that particular task.

## Formats
If you don't have XMind software, I exported the PNG and the Freemind version. If you need other format, please let me know so I can start exporting it in future versions.

## Contribute
New tasks, tools, typos and other things you think it would help this mindset, add a new issue on Github for discussion and validation. This is open to all the infosec community so let us all keep things rolling.

## To do
- Mobile applications mindmap (iOS and Android)
- Networking mindmap (currently working on this)
